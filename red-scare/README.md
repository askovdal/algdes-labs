Running main.py reads data from standard input and runs all algorithms on it.
Therefore, to run on a single file, run 
```
python main.py < data/your_file
```
This prints out the result in a tab separated format in the order
- Alternate
- Few
- Many
- None
- Some

To recreate our results.txt file, run "run-all.sh". This runs the command above for all data files and adds a header.
